This web application aims to take different datasets from PTV's transport information, foursquare and data from events Victoria and transform it to meaningful information.
Hopefully I will be able to use this app to discover new and interesting places along train lines. 

This uses python, html and javascript and the map is based on Google Maps API v3.
